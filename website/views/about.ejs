        <p>Created by NightZan999#0194, and some others (check out the github repository!)
          <br> <br>
          I (NightZan999#0194) have spent about 2 months making the entire bot.
          And inviting it to your server, even if its a small server would help out TheImperialGod.
          <br> <br>
          I started coding TheImperialGod on 26th September, 2020. <br>
          And the first prototype went live on 1st October, 2020 <br> <br>

      <h2>Information about TheImperialGod</h2>

        about it being on top.gg!
        <br> <br>
        I host TheImperialGod on <b>Chaotic Destiny Hosting </b>, they
        keep TheImperialGod online the entire day!
        <br> <br>
        TheImperialGod has a multitude of customizable features
        and settings with <b>over 80 commands!</b> <br> <br>
        The website (the one your seeing now) is coded in
        NodeJS and JavaScript. Thanks to all the contributors
        who helped with the website (check github repository, to see who helped!).
        <br> I did code the <b>entire frontend and colors of the website myself!</b>
        <br> <br> <br>
        The main bot however is made in <a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py"> discord.py or discord for python,
        even though I know <a href="https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js">discord.js </a>and a bit of <a href = "https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA">JDA </a>
