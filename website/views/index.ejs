                <br> <br> I have started to work on this and it is going to be about latest in a month. I am
                using databases and more to track the number of warns. <br> <br>
                It will have a system in which moderators can warn users and they can check the amount of
                warns a user has. <br> <br>
                Additionally we will have a command in which server admins can set a number of warns in which a user
                gets automatically banned. Example: I set it to 5 and when the bot finds a user with 5 warns it bans the user.

            <p>This is almost esstential for any server to have, just like giveaways and economy this is
                complex and will take months to prepare, since it has complex stuff like permissions and more.
                <br> <br>
                This is going to take time, but I can almost confirm that it will be there!<br> <br>
                I could easily make the normal stuff, but I can't make it so that admins can take the conversation
                in a .txt file. That is why, I am working on it, its getting to become big though.

            <h2>Reaction Roles</h2>
            <p>Yes, the hardest task of all, is coming <b>soon.</b> People usually use bots like Carl Bot
                and YAGDB-XYZ for reaction roles. My personal favorite is Carl because he has different modes like
                unique and reversed. <br> <br>
                We are also getting a web dashboard probably around the same time too! Which means you
                can customize the bot with a click of a button. <br> <br>
                I am trying and slowly understanding how to perform complex reaction roles. The
                amount of complexity it is is almost impossible to understand. But well, if all goes well I should be able
                to figure this one out. <b>No confirmation that this will come out to the public. It maybe so that
                    I need the server id and that it can only happen when I hard code it. Join the support server for more information</b>

                This feature will <b>100% come out at one time or another.</b> <br> <br>
                Sadly its not as easy as it <b>sounds</b> like! (pun intended). Music will be our top priority after tickets and
